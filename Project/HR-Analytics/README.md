**Project Background**
----
<div align="justify">
  
This HR Analytics project focuses on understanding patterns of **employee attrition**, a critical challenge facing many organizations. 
The dataset contains a range of employee-related attributes — from job roles and satisfaction levels to overtime hours and income — allowing 
for a detailed exploration of workforce dynamics.

While the dataset does not specify the company, industry, or time period, it includes realistic variables that are commonly found in human resources systems. 
These allow for meaningful analysis of trends and behaviors within a workplace setting.

The primary objective of this project is to uncover the key factors driving attrition, identify high-risk groups, 
and generate actionable insights that support informed decision-making around employee retention and engagement.

**Insights and recommendations are provided in the following sections:**
- Key drivers of employee attrition  
- Attrition trends across departments, roles, and demographics  
- Potential actions to improve retention  
- Suggestions for reducing attrition based on key findings
