**1. Project Overview**
--
This qualitative analysis was conducted as part of a larger baseline assessment aimed at informing the development of a Collaborative Safety and Security Framework (CSSF) in Somalia. 
The overarching goal was to understand community perceptions of **safety**, **trust in law enforcement**, and *access to essential health and security services* in newly liberated areas.

Between December 2024 and January 2025, I had the opportunity to travel to three post-conflict districts in Hirshabelle State, Somalia, My first time working in such contexts. 
These were locations emerging from prolonged insecurity, where community structures were rebuilding and formal policing was still limited. This context shaped both the depth of the 
field experience and my personal growth as an analyst.

The qualitative component of the assessment involved conducting Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with a wide range of community members 
women, youth, elders, local authorities, and security actors.
